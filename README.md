# NextJS + Strapi error reproducer

Available commands:
- `yarn start`: creates a new NextJS app inside `./apps/front-end` and tries running `yarn lint` (it's expected to run smoothly but it fails)
- `yarn reset`: deletes all untracked project files (⚠️ `rm -rf` ⚠️) from your computer to repeat the test with a clean repo
